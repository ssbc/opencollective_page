Scuttlebutt is an ecosystem designed and built for off-grid living, interstellar travel, and disaster resilience. It's form also happens to do away with the _walled-garden_ model which warps platforms with things like advertising, addiction-driven-design, and lock-ins.

Come play a game of chess, or commit some code, or hang out with your family and discuss gender-identity, solarpunk, or vegan-junkfood.

# Why should you fund this?

If you use Scuttlebutt (with a client like Patchwork) and believe in the future being built, this is an easy way to help.

If you are a dev, coop, or company building tech on the Scuttlebutt stack, help give back - the stack is all **Free and Open Source**.

# What does this fund?

There are lots of things to improve in the ecosystem. Could be better documentation, squashing bugs, improving an existing feature. 

There are _so many_ #somebodyshould tagged ideas that would be amazing to nail. Let's collect them and start making the scutleverse ever more awesome.

# Who are The Consortium?

Scuttlebutt is the underlying protocol and database. The Secure Scuttlebutt Consortium (SSBC) is a group of some of the programmers and community-gardeners who have been heavily involved with the development of the tools and the growth of the social space. It's [these lovely people **here**](https://github.com/orgs/ssbc/people).

We've had experience with receiving and distributing grants over the past year, and are excited to use Open Collective to help make  our process more transparent.
